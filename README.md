## Overview

Drawbotage is a web-based drawing game. Teams compete against each other and score points by correctly guessing the word that a teammate has to draw. The team with fewer points can toggle sabotages that hinder the other team's ability to draw (e.g. strokes appear in reverse).

Players can create lobby rooms and invite friends to play using a generated link. Once the game starts, players takes turns drawing words on a live whiteboard. Teammates of the active player can enter guesses into a chat box. A turn ends once the word has been guessed or once time runs out. The team with more points at the end of the game wins.
